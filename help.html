			<center><h1>How to Be More Environmentally Friendly</h1></center>
			<div class="main-div">
				<p>There are many ways that you can help reduce plastic pollution.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Use reusable bags when you go shopping for clothes and groceries.</strong> You can even find small reusable bags for produce. </li>
					<li><strong>Carry a reusable water bottle with you.</strong> While some can be expensive, you will be saving money in the long run. 8-oz glasses of water per day = ~1,920 oz/month = 113-114 16.9-oz water bottles/month. One 24-pack of water bottles = ~$5.00 = ~$23.50/month = <strong>$282 per year</strong>. Stainless steel water bottles can range from $20 - $30 and will last you years.</li>
					<li><strong>When preparing for lunches, use glass tupperware and reusable lunch bags.</strong></li>
					<li>If possible, <strong>bring your own mason jar or glass container to cafés.</strong></li>
					<li>At restaurants, <strong>ask the waiter/waitress to not bring you a straw.</strong> You can also find metal straws and use them at home.</li>
					<li><strong>For those with periods: you can try menstrual cups.</strong> These are better than tampons and pads, as you only to need to change them every 12 hours. One menstrual cup can also last you anywhere from 2 to 10 years. You can sleep while wearing them, too!</li>
					<li><strong>Use bar soap instead of bottled soap.</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Use bamboo toothbrushes instead of plastic ones.</strong> Once you are done, you can simply compost your bamboo toothbrushes.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These are some of the many ways to lead a more environmentally conscious life style. Although all of these options may not be possible for you, what is important is that you try your best!</p>

				<p>There are also many companies and stores that you can support in your journey to become zero-waste.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Starbucks</strong>: the coffee company had a goal of serving 5% of beverages in personal tumblers by 2015. You can save $0.10 every time you bring your own tumbler.</li>
					<li><strong>Target</strong>: the store offers a $0.05 discount for each resuable bag you bring.</li>
					<li><strong>Trader Joe's</strong>: in March 2019, the organic grocery chain made a pledge to cut 1 million pounds of single-use plastic. They also plan to eliminate any non-recyclable plastic and replace styrofoam trays with recyclable PET1 trays.</li>
					<li><strong>Lush</strong>: 35% of the store's products are sold with no packaging. They also use bottles made out of 100% post-consumer plastic.</li>
					<li><strong>Love Beauty and Planet</strong>: this beauty company sells hair and body products in 100% recycled bottles. They are committed to move all of their caps and pumps to use at least 50% recycled plastic by 2020.</li>
					<li><strong>KoolerThings</strong>: this brand sells a pack of 8 bamboo toothbrushes on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biodegradable-Charcoal-Toothbrushes-Compostable-Kooler-Things/dp/B07HRXYYNF/ref=sr_1_4?crid=E6H7H1BM7BJ9&keywords=bamboo+toothbrush&qid=1555182136&s=beauty&sprefix=bamboo+%2Cbeauty%2C116&sr=1-4">Amazon</a> for $11.99.</li>
