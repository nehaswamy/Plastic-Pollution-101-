				<p><strong>recycling (re·​cy·​cle | /ˌrēˈsīkliNG/)</strong>: "the action or process of converting waste into reusable material." (Google Dictionary)</p>

				<p>Recycling is a great way to reduce the amount of plastic waste on our planet. In fact, recycling plastic takes 88% less energy than making plastic from raw materials, according to the Recycling Coalition of Utah. You can also find recyclable plastics, such as water bottles, milk jugs, plastic bags, shampoo bottles, and bottle caps, in almost every part of your home.</p>

				<p>There are many uses for recycled plastic in our everyday life. For example, milk jugs, shampoo bottles, and soap bottles can be used to make new bottles, playground equipment, recycling bins, and outdoor furniture. Recycled plastic bags can be used to create park benches and backyard decks. Water bottles can become clothing, like t-shirts, sweaters, and jackets.</p>

				<p>Even though recycling is a great option to help the environment, there are also downsides to it. Recycling is not always cost effective; it can cost about $4,000 to recycle 1 tonne of plastic bags. Recycling programs can also be huge investment for facilities. While many things are recyclable, some items are surprisingly not, depending on your area. <strong>Not all facilities will accept plastic bags or bottle caps</strong>. If an item that is not recyclable ends up in the recycling bin, the facility may have to throw away all of the products in the bin in the trash.
